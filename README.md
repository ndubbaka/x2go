x2go is a project to develop a low-cost platform for use of edX in
off-line settings.

This repo contains a few portions of this project. In particular, the
Eagle directory contains a PCB design for powering a CubieTruck and a
hard drive from a standard power supply (as comes with many SATA to
USB converters).
